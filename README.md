# NLP and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) projects focused on different aspects of text analysis and classification. These projects utilize various models and techniques to perform tasks such as text summarization, emotion detection, fake news classification, and toxic comment detection.

## Projects

1. **Article News Summarizer**  
   - **Description**: This project focuses on summarizing long articles into concise summaries using NLP techniques.
   - **Technologies Used**: Huggingface Transformers, BERT-based models, NLTK.

2. **Fake vs Real News Classification**  
   - **Description**: A machine learning project that classifies news articles as either fake or real based on the text content.
   - **Technologies Used**: Scikit-learn, Naive Bayes, TF-IDF Vectorization.

3. **Text Emotion Detection**  
   - **Description**: This project performs emotion detection from text, identifying emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
   - **Technologies Used**: Transformers, BERT-based models, and fine-tuned NLP models for emotion classification.

4. **Text Summarization**  
   - **Description**: A text summarization model that can condense lengthy articles into a brief version while retaining key points.
   - **Technologies Used**: Sequence-to-sequence models, BART, T5, Huggingface Transformers.

5. **Toxic Comment Classification**  
   - **Description**: A project aimed at detecting toxic comments, including hate speech, offensive language, and personal attacks in text.
   - **Technologies Used**: Deep Learning, LSTM, BERT, and other NLP techniques.

## Installation

To run these projects locally, you'll need Python 3.x and the necessary libraries. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you need to create a `requirements.txt` file, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `transformers` (Huggingface)
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` or `torch`
- `nltk`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. **Run any notebook**: You can run any of the Jupyter notebooks in this repo. For example:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook article_news_summarizer.ipynb
   ```

3. **For training models**: Each notebook contains code to train models on the respective datasets. Ensure you have the appropriate dataset available or linked before running the code.
